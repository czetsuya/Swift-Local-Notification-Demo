Swift Local Push Notification Demo
=========

This project demonstrate the use of local notification by opening the application. Once the app opens it will open the view and the view will schedule a local notification after 30 seconds.

After 30 seconds the alert will popup and a sound will be played. Note that the app must be running in background or it should be closed for the alert to work.
